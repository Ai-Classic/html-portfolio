<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an aspiring web developer that wants to create a good webpage that will be useful to my future client and would also
  present a better user interface that would be engaging to the people that will eventually use it in the future.
</p>

<p>I have started this journey first as a hobby that sparked from a simple curiosity about how this things work. but as i have
  delved into the world of web developing, I found new skill and interest. but this being a new skill, does not make it any easier for me,
  beacuase this is far from the field I have been currently working on.
</p>

<p>But alas!, even if this is new to me, i would like to keep on pursuing this new interest and also a career for I have found 
  new way to make my self better and also make the most of the time that i have. so for this journey, I would like to keep going 
  forward. may the best of luck fall upon me!
